#
# General information:
# - make sure to use spaced indentation in your Cakebox.yaml, tabbed indents
#   will prevent your box from starting.
#

# Use the "vm:" section to customize your Virtual Machine.
#
#  ip:     ip-address used by your Cakebox
#  memory: amount of memory available to your Cakebox
#  cpus:   number of virtual CPUs available to your Cakebox
#
vm:
    ip: "10.33.10.10"
    memory: 2048
    cpus: 1

# Use the "security:" section to protect ssh access to your Cakebox (RECOMMENDED).
#
#  ssh_public_key:  full path to your personal public key file
#  ssh_private_key: full path to your personal private key file
#
# Please note:
# - only your public key will be copied to the Cakebox
# - your private key will NEVER leave your local machine
# - passphrase protected keys are supported
# - SSH Agent Forwarding will prevent entering passphrase in clear text (RECOMMENDED)
#
# - Windows users:
#   a) MUST NOT use the puttygen "Save public key" button and should instead
#      copy/paste the OpenSSH public key shown in the main puttygen window.
#   b) MUST NOT use the puttygen "Save private key" button and should
#      export it as an OpenSSH key (Puttygen > Conversions > Export)
#   c) will also need a Putty .ppk file to be able to login remotely
#   d) will probably find their local keys in /Users/windows-username/.ssh
#
security:
  ssh_public_key: ~/.ssh/cakebox_rsa.pub
  ssh_private_key: ~/.ssh/cakebox_rsa

# Use the "personal:" section to simplify/personalize Cakebox usage.
#
#  git:
#    username:    your git(hub) username as it will be used by the vagrant user
#    email:       your git email-address as it will be used by the vagrant user
#    private_key: path to your Github private key (local directory will be shared)
#
personal:
    git:
      username: cakeuser@github.com
      email: cakeuser@users.noreply.github.com
      private_key: ~/.ssh/github_rsa

# Use the "synced_folders:" section to create Vagrant Synced Folders responsible
# for auto-syncing data between a folder on your local host machine and a folder
# on the remote Cakebox.
#
#  - local:  path of the local folder
#    remote: path of the remote folder
#    type:   Vagrant supported Synced Folder Type (e.g. nfs, rsync, etc)
#
# Please note:
#  - local paths starting with a(ny) character will be created as subfolders in
#    the local Cakebox root folder
#  - local paths starting with a / are treated as absolute paths
#  - Windows users should avoid using driveletters (Vagrant will conveniently
#    translate / to C:\)
#  - try to avoid sharing the Cakebox root folder (.) as a whole as this could
#    seriously impact performance
#  - all applications generated by the `cakebox application` will be placed
#    in subdirectories below /home/vagrant/Apps
#

    - local:  Apps
      remote: /home/vagrant/Apps
