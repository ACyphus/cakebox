# Cakebox 0.1.1-beta

Homestead on steroids!

## Get productive

Sick and tired of wasting hours on webservers, databases and configuration
before you can actually start hacking away at that prototype?

No more... from now on simply run this command inside your vagrant box:

```bash
$ cakebox application add my.app
```

Which will give you:

+ a fresh copy of your favorite framework
+ a new active virtual host
+ two new databases (one for test purposes)
+ a fully configured application, connected to your database and ready for
development
