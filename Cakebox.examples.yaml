# Customize your Virtual Machine settings by configuring the "vm" section.
#
#  ip:     ip-address used by your Cakebox
#  memory: amount of memory available to your Cakebox
#  cpus:   number of virtual CPUs available to your Cakebox
#
vm:
    ip: "10.33.10.10"
    memory: 2048
    cpus: 1

# Personalize your Cakebox by configuring the "personal" section.
#
#  git:
#    username: your git(hub) username as it will be used by the vagrant user
#    email:    your git email-address as it will be used by the vagrant user
#
personal:

      key: local path (no need to upload key)

# Specify Vagrant "synced_folders" to share data anywhere on your local machine
# and the remote Cakebox.
#
#  - local:  path of the local folder
#    remote: path of the remote folder
#    type:   Vagrant supported Synced Folder Type (e.g. nfs, rsync, etc)
#
# Please note:
#  - local paths starting with a(ny) character will be created as subfolders in
#    the local Cakebox root folder
#  - local paths starting with a / are treated as absolute paths
#  - Windows users should avoid using driveletters (Vagrant will conveniently
#    translate / to C:\)
#  - try to avoid sharing the Cakebox root folder (.) as a whole as this could
#    seriously impact performance
#  - all applications generated by the `cakebox application` will be placed
#    in subdirectories below /home/vagrant/Apps
#
